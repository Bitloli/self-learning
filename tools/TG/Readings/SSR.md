## I. INTRODUCTION: A ROLE FOR HISTORY ............ 1 
The more carefully they study, say, Aristotelian dynamics, phlogistic chemistry, or caloric  thermodynamics, the more certain they feel that those once current  views of nature were, as a whole, neither less scientific nor more the product of human idiosyncrasy than those current today

The same historical research that displays the difficulties in isolating individual inventions and discoveries gives ground for profound doubts about the cumulative process through which these individual contributions to science were thought to have been compounded. 

Gradually, and often without entirely realizing they are doing so, historians of science have begun to ask new sorts of questions and to trace different, and often less than cumulative, **developmental lines** for the sciences. 

Furthermore, they insist upon studying the opinions of that group and other similar ones from the viewpoint—usually very different from that of modern science—that gives those opinions the maximum internal coherence and the closest possible fit to nature.

Seen through the works that result, works perhaps best exemplified in the writings of Alexandre Koyré, science does not seem altogether the same enterprise as the one discussed by writers in the older historiographic tradition. 

What aspects of science will emerge to prominence in the course of this effort? First, at least in order of presentation, is the insufficiency of methodological directives, *by themselves*, to dictate a unique substantive conclusion to many sorts of scientific questions.
