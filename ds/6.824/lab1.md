# Lab 1 : MapReduce
https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/labs/lab-mr.html

In this lab you'll build a MapReduce system. You'll implement a worker process that calls application Map and Reduce functions and handles reading and writing files, and a coordinator process that hands out tasks to workers and copes with failed workers.
