## so, why and how to compile linux kernel with clang ?


## `_ASSEMBLY__`

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28924355/gcc-assembler-preprocessor-not-compatible-with-standard-headers

when reading `arch/x86/include/asm/idtentry.h`,
I can't find the caller of asm_common_interrupt.
There is only one, but ccls's highlight tell me that it will be compiled because of option `_ASSEMBLY__` not selected.
In fact, things doesnâ€™t happened in that way.
ideentry will be include by normal C file and asm file,
when include by asm, `_ASSEMBLY__` will be selected.
