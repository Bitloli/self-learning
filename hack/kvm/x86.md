# x86.c

- [ ] x86_emulate_instruction

```c
/*
 * EMULTYPE_NO_DECODE - Set when re-emulating an instruction (after completing
 *			userspace I/O) to indicate that the emulation context
 *			should be resued as is, i.e. skip initialization of
 *			emulation context, instruction fetch and decode.
 *
 * EMULTYPE_TRAP_UD - Set when emulating an intercepted #UD from hardware.
 *		      Indicates that only select instructions (tagged with
 *		      EmulateOnUD) should be emulated (to minimize the emulator
 *		      attack surface).  See also EMULTYPE_TRAP_UD_FORCED.
 *
 * EMULTYPE_SKIP - Set when emulating solely to skip an instruction, i.e. to
 *		   decode the instruction length.  For use *only* by
 *		   kvm_x86_ops.skip_emulated_instruction() implementations.
 *
 * EMULTYPE_ALLOW_RETRY_PF - Set when the emulator should resume the guest to
 *			     retry native execution under certain conditions,
 *			     Can only be set in conjunction with EMULTYPE_PF.
 *
 * EMULTYPE_TRAP_UD_FORCED - Set when emulating an intercepted #UD that was
 *			     triggered by KVM's magic "force emulation" prefix,
 *			     which is opt in via module param (off by default).
 *			     Bypasses EmulateOnUD restriction despite emulating
 *			     due to an intercepted #UD (see EMULTYPE_TRAP_UD).
 *			     Used to test the full emulator from userspace.
 *
 * EMULTYPE_VMWARE_GP - Set when emulating an intercepted #GP for VMware
 *			backdoor emulation, which is opt in via module param.
 *			VMware backoor emulation handles select instructions
 *			and reinjects the #GP for all other cases.
 *
 * EMULTYPE_PF - Set when emulating MMIO by way of an intercepted #PF, in which
 *		 case the CR2/GPA value pass on the stack is valid.
